# Image Processing Lectures

## Lecture 1: Pixel Transformations

### Topics Covered:
- **Histograms**
  - Histograms count the number of occurrences of pixel intensity values in an image.
  - Useful for understanding and manipulating images.
  - Histograms can be represented as an array where the index represents the intensity level.

- **Intensity Transformations**
  - Modify the intensity of pixels in an image.
  - Example: Image Negatives where intensity levels are reversed.
  - Brightness and Contrast adjustments can be achieved using a linear transformation.

- **Thresholding and Simple Segmentation**
  - Applies a threshold to each pixel to extract objects from an image.
  - **Thresholding Function:** 
    - Outputs pixels based on a condition (e.g., greater than a threshold value).
    - **OTSU Method:** Automatically selects a threshold value for segmentation.

### Key Functions:
- `cv2.calcHist()`: Calculate the histogram.
- `cv2.convertScaleAbs()`: Adjust brightness and contrast.
- `cv2.equalizeHist()`: Perform histogram equalization to improve contrast.
- `cv2.threshold()`: Apply thresholding to segment an image.
- `cv2.THRESH_BINARY`: Type of thresholding where output is either 0 or 255.

## Lecture 2: Geometric Operations

### Topics Covered:
- **Geometric Operations**
  - Modify the geometry of images, including scaling, translation, and rotation.

- **Scaling**
  - **Scaling Factor (a, d):** Used to resize images.
  - Stretch or shrink an image horizontally or vertically.

- **Translation**
  - Shift an image horizontally or vertically by adding a certain number of pixels.

- **Affine Transformations**
  - Mathematical representation of transformations, including scaling, translation, and rotation.

- **Rotation**
  - Rotate an image by an angle Î¸, which can be done using a rotation matrix.

### Key Functions:
- `PIL.Image.resize()`: Resize an image in Python.
- `cv2.resize()`: Rescale an image in OpenCV.
- `cv2.warpAffine()`: Apply affine transformation to an image.
- `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D()`: Get the rotation matrix for rotating an image.

## Lecture 3: Spatial Operations in Image Processing

### Topics Covered:
- **Convolution (Linear Filtering)**
  - **Kernel (Filter):** Small matrix used to perform convolution on an image.
  - **Operation:** Multiply kernel elements by corresponding image elements and sum them to get the output image.

- **Padding**
  - **Zero Padding:** Add rows and columns of zeros around the image to preserve size after convolution.

- **Low Pass Filters**
  - Used to smooth the image by averaging pixel values within a neighborhood.
  - **Mean Filtering:** Averages the intensity values in a kernel.

- **Edge Detection**
  - Detects edges in an image, an important first step in computer vision tasks.

### Key Functions:
- `cv2.filter2D()`: Apply a convolution filter to an image.
- `cv2.copyMakeBorder()`: Add padding to an image.
- `cv2.GaussianBlur()`: Apply a Gaussian filter to blur an image.

### Additional Notes:
- Explore the provided lab examples to better understand the application of these concepts in real-world scenarios.
- Familiarize yourself with OpenCV and PIL functions to perform various image processing tasks.
