## Introduction to Image Classification
- **Image Classification**: The process of automatically categorizing images into predefined classes or labels (e.g., cat, car, building).
- **Class Label (Y)**: A label or category assigned to an image (e.g., Y = 0 for cat, Y = 1 for dog).
- **Intensity Values**: Computers process images as arrays of intensity values (e.g., RGB or grayscale values).

### Common Use Cases
- **Smartphone photo organization**: Automatically grouping images by friends, families, trips, etc.
- **Medical Imaging**: Assisting in identifying anomalies in radiology (e.g., X-rays).
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Classifying objects in the environment to navigate roads safely.

## Challenges in Image Classification
- **Variability in Viewpoint**: Objects can appear different depending on the angle or distance.
- **Illumination Changes**: Lighting conditions can drastically alter the appearance of an object.
- **Deformation**: Objects can be deformed or vary in shape.
- **Occlusion**: Parts of the object might be hidden by other objects.
- **Background Clutter**: The presence of multiple objects or noise in the background complicates classification.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### What is KNN?
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple and intuitive classification algorithm that classifies an unknown data point based on the classes of its `K` nearest neighbors.

### How KNN Works
1. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between the unknown sample and all other samples using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
2. **Find Nearest Neighbors**: Identify the `K` closest samples (neighbors) to the unknown sample.
3. **Majority Voting**: The class with the most samples among the `K` nearest neighbors is assigned to the unknown sample.
4. **Label Assignment**: The unknown sample is classified into the most common class among its neighbors.

### Model Evaluation
- **Training and Testing Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, often in a 70-30 split, to build the model and evaluate its performance.
- **Accuracy Calculation**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model on the test data.

### Choosing the Value of K
- **Validation Set**: Further split the data into training, validation, and test sets to determine the optimal `K`.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The value of `K` that maximizes accuracy on the validation set is selected for the final model.

### Limitations of KNN
- **Computational Complexity**: KNN is slow and computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
- **High-Dimensional Data**: Struggles with datasets that have many features (high-dimensionality).
- **Sensitivity to Noise**: KNN can be heavily influenced by noisy data or irrelevant features.
