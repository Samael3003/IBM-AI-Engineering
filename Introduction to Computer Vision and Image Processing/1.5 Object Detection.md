## Introduction to Object Detection

### Overview
- **Object Detection** involves identifying the presence, location, and class of multiple objects within an image.
- It combines both **classification** and **localization** tasks:
  - **Classification**: Predicts the class of an object in an image.
  - **Localization**: Identifies the position of an object using bounding boxes.
- **Object Detection** extends these tasks by locating and classifying multiple objects within a single image.

### Key Concepts
- **Sliding Windows**: A method used to systematically search for objects within an image by moving a window across the image.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Rectangular boxes that define the location of an object in an image.
- **Score**: A confidence value indicating how certain the model is about its prediction.

## Sliding Window Algorithm

### Overview
- The **Sliding Window** algorithm is a method to detect objects in an image by dividing it into smaller regions and classifying each region.

### Key Concepts
- **Window Size**: The fixed size of the sub-image being analyzed.
- **Sub-image Classification**: Each sub-image (window) is classified as either the object of interest (e.g., a dog) or as background.
- **Systematic Approach**: The window slides across the image horizontally and vertically, ensuring every part of the image is analyzed.

### Steps
1. **Select Window Size**: Choose a window size appropriate for the object.
2. **Classify Sub-images**: Classify each sub-image as either the object or background.
3. **Move Window**: Slide the window across the image, both horizontally and vertically, and repeat the classification.

### Challenges
- **Overlapping Detections**: Multiple detections for the same object.
- **Object Size Variation**: Objects can appear in different sizes, requiring resizing or reshaping of the image.
- **Overlapping Objects**: Handling objects that overlap within the image.

## Bounding Boxes

### Overview
- **Bounding Boxes** are used to localize objects within an image by defining a rectangular area around them.

### Key Concepts
- **Coordinates**: Defined by the upper-left corner `(x_min, y_min)` and lower-right corner `(x_max, y_max)` of the rectangle.
- **Object Detection Goal**: Predict the bounding box coordinates that encapsulate the object.

### Example
- For a bounding box with coordinates `(0,1)` and `(7,8)`, the goal is to predict these points accurately.

## Bounding Box Pipeline

### Overview
- The **Bounding Box Pipeline** involves training a model to predict both the class and the bounding box coordinates of objects within an image.

### Key Concepts
- **Dataset**: Consists of images labeled with both class labels and bounding box coordinates.
- **Model Training**: The model learns to predict the class and location of objects based on the dataset.

### Steps
1. **Input Image**: Provide an image with objects to detect.
2. **Prediction**: The model outputs the predicted class and bounding box coordinates.
3. **Result**: Visualize the bounding boxes around detected objects.

## Score and Image Classification

### Overview
- **Score**: A confidence measure that indicates how certain the model is about its prediction.
- **Image Classification**: Predicts the class of an object and assigns a confidence score.

### Key Concepts
- **Thresholding**: Only accepting predictions above a certain score threshold to improve accuracy.
- **Model Confidence**: High score indicates high confidence in the prediction.

### Example
- An image predicted as a dog with a score of `0.99` indicates high confidence, whereas a score of `0.5` indicates low confidence.

## Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers

### Overview
- **Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers** are used for detecting objects like cars, traffic lights, and pedestrians in images.

### Key Concepts
- **Haar Features**: Features extracted from images using Haar wavelets, which capture edges, lines, and textures.
- **Integral Image**: A technique that allows fast computation of Haar features by using a summed-area table.
- **AdaBoost**: An algorithm that selects the most important features and constructs a strong classifier by combining weak classifiers.
- **Cascade of Classifiers**: A series of classifiers applied sequentially, where each stage filters out regions unlikely to contain the object.

### Steps
1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract Haar features from training images.
2. **Integral Image**: Compute the sum of pixel values to speed up feature computation.
3. **Feature Selection**: Use AdaBoost to select the most important features.
4. **Cascade of Classifiers**: Apply a series of classifiers to detect objects in sub-windows of the image.

### Example
- To detect a car in an image, the algorithm groups sub-images and applies the classifiers stage by stage, discarding regions that don't match the object.
