# Introduction to Computer Vision

## Overview

This course introduces the field of computer vision, covering its applications across various industries. The primary focus is on implementing computer vision techniques using Python and OpenCV. The course does not delve into the underlying mechanics of computer vision, neural networks, or the mathematical foundations.

## Course Objectives

- Understand what computer vision is.
- Apply and use computer vision algorithms with Python and OpenCV.
- Create custom classifiers for business problems.
- Build a web app to classify images.

## What You Will Not Learn

- How computer vision works internally.
- The workings of neural networks or deep learning.
- Math and statistics related to computer vision.

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Computer Vision

### Key Concepts:

- **Computer Vision Definition**: Computer vision is the science of enabling computers to see and understand images.
  
- **Industry Impact**: 
  - **Automation**: Self-driving cars, faster processes, reduced costs, and increased convenience.
  - **Applications**: Found in automotive, manufacturing, HR, insurance, healthcare, and more.

### Case Studies:

1. **ADNOC** (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company):
   - Used IBM Watson to classify rock images, drastically reducing time spent by geologists.
   
2. **Knockri**:
   - A Canadian startup that uses computer vision to assess soft skills during interviews, helping in candidate shortlisting.

## Lecture 2: Applications of Computer Vision

### Use Cases:

1. **Video Searchability**:
   - Computer vision tags objects in videos, making specific scenes searchable.

2. **Infrastructure Maintenance**:
   - Drones capture images of structures (like electric towers), and computer vision classifies rust severity, saving costs for insurance companies.

3. **Insurance Claims**:
   - Automating damage assessment (e.g., from hail) through image classification can save time and resources.

### Key Takeaways:

- Computer vision can simplify complex, labor-intensive tasks across various sectors by automating visual data analysis.
- It is especially impactful in industries requiring detailed visual inspection or categorization.

## Lecture 3: Active Research in Computer Vision

### Research Highlights:

1. **Object Detection**:
   - Facebook’s research on efficient object detection in images and videos, crucial for applications like self-driving cars.

2. **Image-to-Image Translation**:
   - UC Berkeley’s work on converting images from one scene to another (e.g., horse to zebra, summer to winter).

3. **Motion Transfer**:
   - The "Everybody Dance Now" project transfers dance moves from one person to another using computer vision techniques.

### Innovative Applications:

- Transforming images and videos to create new, engaging content or for practical applications like enhancing safety in autonomous systems.

## Lecture 4: Ideation in Computer Vision

### Problem-Solving with Computer Vision:

- **Approach**: Start with identifying existing problems rather than focusing on solutions.
- **Examples**:
  - **Medicine**: Training doctors to detect cancer more accurately.
  - **Driving**: Assisting drivers by monitoring their focus or detecting potential hazards.
  - **Security**: Streamlining suspect identification in surveillance footage.
  - **Manufacturing**: Ensuring product quality in large-scale production.
  - **Construction Safety**: Ensuring compliance with safety regulations.
  - **Insurance**: Automated assessment of vehicle damage after accidents.

### Idea Generation Tips:

- Reflect on personal or professional challenges that could be solved with visual automation.
- Consider how computer vision can enhance convenience or efficiency in everyday tasks.
