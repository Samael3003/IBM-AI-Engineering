## **Introduction to Regression**

### **What is Regression?**
Regression is a statistical method used to predict a continuous dependent variable (Y) based on one or more independent variables (X).

- **Dependent Variable (Y):** The target variable we want to predict.
- **Independent Variable (X):** The explanatory variable(s) used to make predictions.

### **Types of Regression**
1. **Simple Regression:** Predicts Y using one X (e.g., predicting CO2 emissions based on engine size).
2. **Multiple Regression:** Predicts Y using more than one X (e.g., predicting CO2 emissions using engine size and the number of cylinders).

### **Applications of Regression**
- **Sales Forecasting:** Predicting yearly sales based on variables like age, education, and experience.
- **Psychology:** Determining satisfaction based on demographic factors.
- **Real Estate:** Estimating house prices based on features like size and number of bedrooms.

### **Interactive Question 1:**
**Can regression be used to predict a discrete outcome (like yes/no)? Why or why not?**

## **Understanding Linear Regression**

### **What is Linear Regression?**
Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X) with a linear equation.

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Involves one independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Involves multiple independent variables.

### **Linear Regression Equation**
The equation of a simple linear regression is:
\[ \hat{Y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 X_1 \]

- **\(\hat{Y}\):** Predicted value.
- **\(\theta_0\):** Intercept (value of Y when X = 0).
- **\(\theta_1\):** Slope (change in Y for a unit change in X).

### **Fitting the Line**
Linear regression finds the best fit line by minimizing the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, which measures the average of the squares of the errors (differences between observed and predicted values).

### **Interactive Activity 1:**
**Plotting a Regression Line:**
Using a simple dataset, plot the points and draw the line of best fit. Calculate the slope (\(\theta_1\)) and intercept (\(\theta_0\)) manually.

### **Interactive Question 2:**
**What does it mean if the slope (\(\theta_1\)) is negative?**

## **Model Evaluation in Regression**

### **Why Evaluate a Model?**
The goal is to determine how well our model can predict unknown data. Two common evaluation approaches are:

1. **Train and Test on the Same Dataset:** Risk of overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data.
2. **Train/Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to better evaluate model performance.

### **Accuracy Metrics:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared:** Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

### **Interactive Activity 2:**
**Model Testing:**
Split a dataset into a training set and a testing set. Train a regression model on the training data and calculate MSE and R-squared on the testing data.

### **Interactive Question 3:**
**Why might a model perform well on training data but poorly on testing data?**

## **Summary & Key Takeaways**

- **Regression** is a fundamental tool in data analysis used to predict continuous outcomes.
- **Linear regression** is simple yet powerful, useful for understanding relationships between variables.
- **Model evaluation** is crucial for ensuring that predictions are reliable and generalize well to new data.
