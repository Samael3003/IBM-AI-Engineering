## Question 2
**Which of the following statements comparing linear and logistic regressions is TRUE?**

- [ ] Independent variables in linear regression can be continuous or categorical, but can only be categorical in logistic regression.
- [ ] In this course, linear regression minimizes the mean absolute error, while logistic regression minimizes the mean squared error.
- [ ] Linear regression is used for a continuous target whereas logistic regression is more suitable for a categorical target.
- [ ] Both linear and logistic regression can be used to predict categorical responses and attain a pointâ€™s likelihood of belonging to each class.

## Question 3
**How are gradient descent and learning rate used in logistic regression?**

- [ ] We want to minimize the cost by maximizing the learning rate value.
- [ ] Gradient descent will minimize learning rate to minimize the cost in fewer iterations.
- [ ] Gradient descent specifies the steps to take in the current slope direction, learning rate is the step length.
- [ ] Gradient descent takes increasingly bigger steps towards the minimum with each iteration.
