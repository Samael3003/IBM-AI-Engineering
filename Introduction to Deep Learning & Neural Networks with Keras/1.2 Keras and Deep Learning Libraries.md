## Overview of Deep Learning Libraries

### Popular Libraries
- **TensorFlow**:
  - Developed by Google and released in 2015.
  - Widely used for production deep learning models.
  - Large community support and continuous development.
- **PyTorch**:
  - Developed by Facebook and released in 2016.
  - Preferred in academic research and deep learning applications that require optimizing custom expressions.
  - Known for its flexibility and native feel in Python.
- **Keras**:
  - High-level API for building deep learning models.
  - Simplifies the process of developing deep learning models.
  - Runs on top of TensorFlow and is ideal for beginners due to its ease of use.

### Deprecated Library
- **Theano**:
  - Developed by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms.
  - Previously popular before TensorFlow and PyTorch.
  - No longer actively maintained.

### Key Takeaways
- **Keras**: Best for quick model building and fast development.
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch**: Offer more control and flexibility, ideal for complex models and production.

## Building Regression Models using Keras

### Platform Setup
- **Cognitive Class Labs (CC Labs)**:
  - Used for running lab sessions.
  - Pre-installed Keras library for convenience.

### Example Dataset: Concrete Compressive Strength
- Dataset contains volumes of different materials used to make concrete and their compressive strengths after 28 days.
- The goal is to predict compressive strength based on the material volumes.

### Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 8 features (predictors).
- **Hidden Layers**: 2 hidden layers, each with 5 neurons.
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron to predict compressive strength.

### Model Building Steps
1. **Import Libraries**:
   ```python
   import keras
   from keras.models import Sequential
   from keras.layers import Dense
   ```
2. **Create Model**:
   ```python
   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu', input_shape=(8,)))
   model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(1))
   ```
3. **Compile Model**:
   - Optimizer: `adam` (automatically handles the learning rate).
   - Loss Metric: `mean squared error`.
   ```python
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
   ```
4. **Train Model**:
   ```python
   model.fit(predictors, target, epochs=50)
   ```
5. **Predict**:
   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(new_data)
   ```

### Key Notes
- Use ReLU activation for hidden layers.
- Adam optimizer is preferred over traditional gradient descent for efficiency.

## Building Classification Models using Keras

### Example Dataset: Car Purchase Decision
- Dataset features include price, maintenance cost, and seating capacity.
- Target variable: Decision (0: Not Acceptable, 1: Acceptable, 2: Good, 3: Very Good).

### Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 8 features (predictors).
- **Hidden Layers**: 2 hidden layers, each with 5 neurons.
- **Output Layer**: 4 neurons (one for each class).

### Model Building Steps
1. **Import Libraries**:
   ```python
   from keras.utils import to_categorical
   from keras.models import Sequential
   from keras.layers import Dense
   ```
2. **One-Hot Encoding for Target Variable**:
   ```python
   target = to_categorical(raw_target)
   ```
3. **Create Model**:
   ```python
   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu', input_shape=(8,)))
   model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(4, activation='softmax'))
   ```
4. **Compile Model**:
   - Loss Metric: `categorical_crossentropy`.
   - Evaluation Metric: `accuracy`.
   ```python
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```
5. **Train Model**:
   ```python
   model.fit(predictors, target, epochs=50)
   ```
6. **Predict**:
   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(new_data)
   ```

### Key Notes
- Use softmax activation for the output layer in classification problems.
- Use categorical cross-entropy for loss and accuracy for evaluation in classification.
